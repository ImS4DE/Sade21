Who is better Lunar Client or Salwyrr Client?????

Starting by Salwyrr Client: 
On Salwyrr Client, you have a very good amounts of Mods/Option to set on your minecraft to enhance your gameplay experience, yup thats good, you can get lower ping and very high fps with certain configurations, and u allowed to play on every cracked server if you use the Offline/Cracked account that Salwyrr gives to us. And you can decor all your sky,overlay,map with only some clicks! that its a good client for who is starting PvP. But be happy we discovered a way to get an Offline/Cracked account because recently Salwyrr Client disabled the option to create a cracked account but some players discovered a method to take this feature back to live! It takes only 3 Steps:
First : Windowns+R, then write %appdata%/.salwyrr ( first you need to download then download your version, after this you click on play and after joining on the menu leave the game)
Secomd: Go to Client Properties.
Third: Write on the third line : Account= (your name).    https://www.salwyrr.com (Download!)         

Now the Lunar Client:
I used the a method to play on a Cracked account its called the Lunar Client QT! its a modified version of Lunar Client, but to use it u need to do some steps to allow you to join the Multiplayer servers! because Lunar Client Team patched it. You need to put a Anti-Agent to allow you to play on the servers. By the way, the lunar client its very good super good amoutn of Mods/Options,cosmetics,accessories and etc... But there is negatives things: High Ping (Ms) but there is a High Fps (like the Salwyrr Client) if you are a video recorded that record Minecraft i reccomend Lunar client with a very good settings, to enhance your gameplay and play softly i can say.
